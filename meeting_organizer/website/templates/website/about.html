  <p>I am a dedicated father of two with 15 years of experience in the security environment. Throughout my career, I have developed a strong foundation in maintaining safety and security, ensuring a secure environment for both people and property. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by completing a Full Stack Web Development course at the Code Institute. This new venture has ignited a deep passion for technology and coding within me. I am enthusiastic about combining my extensive experience in security with my newfound skills in web development to pursue innovative and dynamic opportunities in the tech industry.</p>
